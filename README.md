## How to run the project

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) _(only when using Git CLI)_.

From your command line, clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/danilodecanini/radial-progress-indicator.git
```

To run the application:

```bash
# Go into directory radial-progress-indicator/
$ cd radial-progress-indicator
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
# Run the application
$ npm run dev
```

Remix will start building and serve a http link, click on that link.
The link will open a new tab on your browser with the application started.

At `app/routes/_index.tsx` you can change the returned values from the loader, and change the component behavior (line 18)
